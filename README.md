## About the Project
Welcome to the Northern Lights Society, part of the ME1640 course at Blekinge Institute of Technology. This project marks the beginning of an interactive platform designed to offer users exciting digital escape rooms and stories that push the boundaries of storytelling and gaming.

### Project Background
This project is the final product of the ME1640 course, which is structured around group-based project work. We have used agile methods, particularly Scrum, to drive the project's development from conceptualization to final product.
